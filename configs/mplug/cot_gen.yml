Each of them is holding a stemmed glass filled with liquid and gesturing towards the camera. There are olive-like objects in the glasses, and given the dim indoor setting, we can infer that they might be drinking in a bar. The phrase 'to do this' mentioned in the question likely refers to drinking alcohol. So the real question is at what age one can drink legally in Canada.
